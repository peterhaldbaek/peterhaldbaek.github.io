Finally my first iPhone app has hit the stores. The iPhone version of Find Antenna is available for download from the App Store. The functionality is the same as the Android version with some minor differences. I put a lot of work into the visual appearance of both app and icon to give a clearer visual identity. I also changed the layout of the app a little bit by using a scrollview instead of gesture recognizers to switch between transmitters. Representation of the signal strength was also changed to give a clearer indication on how to interpret the strength of the signal.

The first version of the app only contains Danish transmitters but more countries are expected to be supported shortly. I will add Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom and Australia in the near future. If you want your country added or have information on transmitters not on the list do not hesitate to contact me. 

The app is available at the App Store so go get it while it's hot!
