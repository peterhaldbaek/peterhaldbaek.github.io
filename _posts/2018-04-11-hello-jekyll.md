Back from a long blogging hiatus I decided to call it quits on DocPad and move the blog to a simpler platform. Although I did like DocPad it seemed like it was losing support and in the end it was just too cumbersome to keep track on Node versions, modules and what not.

So now I'm taking a dive with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Why? Posting is just a whole lot easier when all you need to do is write something directly on GitHub. No deployment steps or anything, just plain markdown. And having support for tables (through kramdown) was a nice bonus as well. So time to start blogging on my latest endevaours into iOS and Swift!
