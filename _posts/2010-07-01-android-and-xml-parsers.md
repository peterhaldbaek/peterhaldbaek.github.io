My first baby steps into the world of Android development has me started with writing a classic RSS feed application. I started out looking into basic UI and when that was done I focused on how to import a feed into Android. While searching for answers I came across [this article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/x-android/index.html) on how to read a RSS feed with Android. It explains the different possibilities for parsing the returned XML in a very straight-forward manner and I highly recommend reading the piece. It is a really good read also if you just need to brush up your XML parsing skills on the Java platform.
