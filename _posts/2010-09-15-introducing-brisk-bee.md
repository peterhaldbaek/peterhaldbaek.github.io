So I decided to go solo and start my own company. Developing applications for the mobile platform have been on my radar for some years now and I finally decided it was time to try it out. The name of the company is Brisk Bee and so the name of this blog has changed to reflect this. I spent a lot of time trying to think of a catchy name and this was not my best effort but the best effort where the domain was still available (yes, I am looking at you [Foul Owl](http://foulowl.com/)!). Looking up brisk at [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/brisk) reveals this information:

> brisk
>    /brɪsk/ [brisk] adjective, -er, -est, verb
> –adjective
> 1. quick and active; lively: brisk trading; a brisk walk.
> 2. sharp and stimulating: brisk weather; brisk wind.
> 3. (of liquors) effervescing vigorously: brisk cider.
> 4. abrupt; curt: I was surprised by her rather brisk tone.
> –verb (used with object), verb (used without object)
> 5. to make or become brisk; liven (often fol. by up ).So my name means something like quick or active bee. Which I think is a great metaphor for what I want to do, getting some work done. I also bought the domain [phonypony.com](http://phonypony.com) since it was really catchy but I find it hard to picture myself as a pony, especially a phony one. Heck, I'll probably find some use for that later.

I will have my last day at work in my current job on September 30th and start as a contractor on October 1st. In my (very sparse) spare time I will pursue my mobile aspirations. I am currently working on implementing an ORM for Android, think [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org) meets [ActiveRecord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern). Hopefully I will blog more on this later.
