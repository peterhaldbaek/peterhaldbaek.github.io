I just decided to upgrade the layout of the blog a little and I am very pleased with the results so far. Improvements made are:

* New layout provided by a free template made by [Andreas Virklund](http://www.andreasviklund.com/) and modified to fit into the world of Blogger by [Gecko and Fly](http://www.geckoandfly.com/blogspot-templates/).
* Syntax highlighting with [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter).
* Image display with [lytebox](http://www.dolem.com/lytebox/) (initially I wanted to use [lightbox](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/) but I could not make it work in Blogger).

Still some minor pieces missing but I am more or less done for now.
