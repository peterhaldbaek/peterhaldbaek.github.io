Traveling to Khao Lak from the south you will pass a little restaurant called [Muanlai](http://www.baankrating.com/KhaoLak/restaurant-muanlai.aspx) about 1 km after the entrance to the [Khao Lak-Lam Ru National Park](http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=47&amp;lg=2). The restaurant sits on the hillside with unspoiled and spectacular views of the Khao Lak beach. It is the perfect spot for watching the sun set or just relax. It does not hurt either that the food is great and pretty cheap too. It is located a bit outside of Khao Lak so if you are staying in Khao Lak you either need to walk 2-3 kms or grab a tuk-tuk. It is within walking distance of most of the resorts in the southern part of Khao Lak but since it is situated in the opposite direction of Khao Lak it is easy to overlook this marvelous place.
