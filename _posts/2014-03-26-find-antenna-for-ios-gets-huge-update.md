Months of waiting is finally over. The iOS version of Find Antenna finally supports the same countries as the Android version which means iPhone users in the United Kingdom, Germany and Sweden can now enjoy the app just as users in Denmark have been able to for some months. The update was also used to adjust some of the Danish transmitters since Boxer has decided to upgrade the transmitters at Borups Alle and Lynetten.

When the app starts it will automatically show you the transmitters of the country with the best signal. You can change country by clicking the menu icon at the top left and simply select the country you are interested in. It's as easy as that!
