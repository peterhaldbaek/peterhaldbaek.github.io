My very first mobile app was officially released yesterday. I have spent many evenings on ridiculous details and I am happy to say that the app is ready at last. The app can be used to determine the 5 closest DVB-T transmitters and in which direction they can be found. It is very useful if you want to figure out which way your TV antenna should point. It uses the location of the mobile phone to determine which transmitters are closest and the compass to determine the direction.

The app is currently only available for Android. You can find at Google Play by clicking the icon above.
