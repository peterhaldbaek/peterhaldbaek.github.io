Developing applications for the mobile platform have been on my radar for some years now and I finally decided it was time to try it out. The name of the company is Brisk Bee and so the name of this blog has changed to reflect this. I spent a lot of time trying to think of a catchy name and this was not my best effort but the best effort where the domain was still available (yes, I am looking at you <a href="http://foulowl.com/">Foul Owl</a>!). Looking up brisk at <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/brisk">dictionary.com</a> reveals this information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>brisk
   /brɪsk/ [brisk] adjective, -er, -est, verb
–adjective</p>
<ol>
<li>quick and active; lively: brisk trading; a brisk walk.</li>
<li>sharp and stimulating: brisk weather; brisk wind.</li>
<li>(of liquors) effervescing vigorously: brisk cider.</li>
<li>abrupt; curt: I was surprised by her rather brisk tone.
–verb (used with object), verb (used without object)</li>
<li>to make or become brisk; liven (often fol. by up ).So my name means something like quick or active bee. Which I think is a great metaphor for what I want to do, getting some work done. I also bought the domain <a href="http://phonypony.com">phonypony.com</a> since it was really catchy but I find it hard to picture myself as a pony, especially a phony one. Heck, I&#39;ll probably find some use for that later.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I will have my last day at work in my current job on September 30th and start as a contractor on October 1st. In my (very sparse) spare time I will pursue my mobile aspirations. I am currently working on implementing an ORM for Android, think <a href="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> meets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern">ActiveRecord</a>. Hopefully I will blog more on this later.</p>

Imagine this situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Module A contains a base test class</li>
<li>Module B depends on module A</li>
<li>Module B imports the base test class of module A in its unit test</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create a <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> and I have spent numerous hours (days, months?) trying to figure out what the problem was. Until today when I came across this helpful <a href="http://www.mailinglistarchive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg33474.html">post</a>. If you are too lazy to follow the link I will give you the solution here. You need to let module A generate the test classes in a test jar file and make module B dependent on this jar file. Add this to the pom.xml of module A to make it generate the test jar file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;executions&gt;
    &lt;execution&gt;
      &lt;goals&gt;
       &lt;goal&gt;test-jar&lt;/goal&gt;
      &lt;/goals&gt;
    &lt;/execution&gt;
  &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code></pre><p>And add this to the pom.xml of module B to make it dependent on it:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;some.group&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;A&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;type&gt;test-jar&lt;/type&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre><p>Build module A by issuing the command <code>mvn clean install</code> and run your tests in module B by issuing the command <code>mvn clean test</code>. That should do the trick.</p>

This was introduced in the US and UK and I expected this to spread out to the rest of World pretty quickly. I could not be more wrong. As of today Android Market only offers <a href="http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=138294">paid apps in these countries</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Austria</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>Italy</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>Netherlands</li>
<li>New Zealand</li>
<li>Spain</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>United States</li>
</ul>
<p>Where is Scandinavia not to mention countries like China, India and Brazil (or say South America)? I cannot believe that we 18 months later lack big economies like China and India. It is beyond me. What could the reasons for this be? Apple had the advantage of building their App Store within the concepts defined by iTunes and thereby inherited the easy <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/how-to/index.html#store-oneclick">1-Click</a> shopping philosophy. Google do not have this but Google&#39;s pennant to 1-Click <a href="http://checkout.google.com/">Google Checkout</a> is not a bad competitor so what is holding them back?</p>
<p>My fears are that if Google does not address this matter soon the Android Market will die. It will be separated into two markets (already happening), paid apps from the countries inside the paid apps zone competing against free apps from countries outside of the zone. This will drive prices on apps down making it harder for developers to make a living of creating apps thus decreasing the quality of the apps in the store. When the quality of apps drops people start looking for better alternatives and my guess is they will turn to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/">Apple App Store</a>. I am not blaming them.</p>
<p>Now, developers can make money on their apps in other ways than getting paid upfront for the app. They can add ads to their app or offer more functionality (or ad-free apps) outside of the store. But then the developer would have to worry about implementing their own payment service which again would drive developers to other alternatives. If Google does not see this I am afraid the Android Market will die before it even got started.</p>

<p>Apparently my rant had some effect. South Korea has been added to the list! On a more hilarious note, I really like the image of the Android Market in my first link (the Engadget article).</p>

QCon runs five times a year in London, San Francisco, Tokyo, Beijing, and Sao Paulo so travel distance is not a concern (although I have no problem with traveling to the US, Asia or especially Brazil). The target audience is team leads, architects, and project management and the conference rely heavily on the community. Hopefully some of the spirit from <a href="http://www.softwaresummit.com/">Colorado Software Summit</a> can be found there. Next conference is November 1st - 5th 2010 in San Francisco.</p>

The mobile applications need to take advantage of the information and processing power within the cloud. I have been looking for ways of implementing cloud services in the most efficient manner but have not come up with the holy grail yet. I need a lightweight service layer exposing its services as REST services. Until now I considered using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> for this (I still do) but after I started playing around with the Android framework I thought the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> maybe could offer something.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/options_for__rest_framework/gaerestlet.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Today I discovered that <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a> integrates with GAE so that is another option worth exploring.</p>
