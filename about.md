My name is Peter Haldb√¶k and this is my little blogging space. I do web for a living and mobile for fun so these are
the topics I usually write about but it could be anything really. I am the creator of the Find Antenna app (available
on both [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-antenna/id759184885?mt=8) and
[Android](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.briskbee.master)).

You can also find me on Twitter ([@phaldbaek](http://twitter.com/phaldbaek)), Github
([@peterhaldbaek](http://github.com/peterhaldbaek)) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhaldbaek).

If you are looking for help with anything web or mobile go ahead and give me a call. Really.
