Wishful thinking indeed but yesterday Google informed Android developers that paid apps are coming to new markets soon. No details were released on which countries Google would add but there have been [rumors](http://www.androidcentral.com/google-begins-testing-paid-market-apps-india) that India is being added anytime soon. No need to tell I am hoping for Denmark to be added but do not expect this since it is such a small market compared to countries not yet on the list (China, Brazil etc.).
Here is the mail from Google:

> Hello,
> 
> We're writing to inform you about some changes to Android Market that require your attention.
> 
> Over the next few weeks, we’ll be adding paid apps support for additional countries.  If you have selected to publish your paid apps to all locations and intend to support all new locations as we expand the number of supported countries for paid apps, you don’t have to do anything.  If you have selected to publish your paid apps to all locations but intend to only target the currently supported 14 countries, please update your location selections to target these specific countries.
> 
> Please look for follow-up emails when we introduce paid apps support for specific additional countries in the coming weeks.  At that time, you’ll have the option to target these specific countries.
> 
> Thanks, and we look forward to continue working with you on Android
> Market.
> 
> Sincerely,
> The Android Market Team
