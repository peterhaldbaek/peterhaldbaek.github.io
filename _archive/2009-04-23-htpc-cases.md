Here is a quick list of cases I have been looking at for my HTPC:

## Antec NSK2480

[![Antec NSK2480](/assets/img/NSK2400_f.jpg)](http://www.antec.com/Believe_it/product.php?id=MzI=)

* Pros: Cheap, ships with a PSU, very silent, good cooling, spacious inside, good fans, easy to customize
* Cons: Plastic front, no VFD, no IR, no card reader, fitting an optical drive probably ruins the aesthetics, big, visible ports

## Antec Fusion Remote

* Pros: Great design, good cooling, spacious inside, good fans, very silent, optical drive hidden
* Cons: No PSU, no card reader, a little expensive, IR not very responsive, big, visible ports

## Silverstone LC19R

[![Silverstone LC19R](/assets/img/LC19-3-4.jpg)](http://www.silverstonetek.com/products/p_spec.php?pno=lc19&amp;area=usa)

* Pros: Tiny, card reader, ports hidden, ships with a fanless PSU
* Cons: A little expensive, not a lot of cooling because of the cramped space, only space for one PCI card, the PSU is only 120W, external PSU, optical drive must be slim
