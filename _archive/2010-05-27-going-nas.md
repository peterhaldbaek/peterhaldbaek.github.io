[Network-attached storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) (or just NAS) is all the rage at the moment (or has been for some time now). The amount of computers in households are rising and the need for accessing documents and data from more than just one device is becoming increasingly popular. Instead of storing documents and data on all these computers the NAS will provide the household with a centralized document and data store making it easier to access and share data within the household but also easier to implement efficient and consistent backup procedures.

I have been looking at buying a NAS for some time but initially thought my HTPC build could serve as a NAS. Unfortunately power efficiency has not been satisfactory for my HTPC (it uses something like 60 W idle). Furthermore I have come to the conclusion I am better of separating the two things, so my HTPC does not end up as a multipurpose server. The wear and tear on harddrives in a HTPC is bigger compared to a NAS server since the HTPC will make many write operations compared to the NAS.

My main requirement for the NAS is that it has to be power-efficient. Other (not-so-important) requirements are price, [SqueezeBox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox_Server) server capability and maybe support for RAID.

I have looked at products from [QNAP](http://www.qnap.com/), [Synology](http://www.synology.com/) and [Netgear](http://www.netgear.com/) for no other reason than products from these companies seem to be the most popular choices today. Other products from other manufacturers may excel. The NAS products I have looked at are

*   [QNAP TS-109 Pro II](http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=92) (TS-109)
*   [QNAP TS-119 Turbo NAS](http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=112) (TS-119)
*   [QNAP TS-210 Turbo NAS](http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=135) (TS-210)
*   [Synology DS110j](http://www.synology.com/enu/products/DS110j/index.php) (DS110j)
*   [Synology DS210j](http://www.synology.com/enu/products/DS210j/index.php) (DS210j)
*   [Netgear ReadyNAS Duo RND2000](http://www.netgear.com/Products/Storage/ReadyNASDuo/RND2000.aspx) (RND2000)

None of these products come with preinstalled hard drives. They are all able to run SqueezeBox server.

Here is a quick comparison of the specifications I find most interesting:

<sup>1</sup> I am highly skeptical this number is correct.

<sup>2</sup> With 2 500 Gb disks.

The best performers are shown in italics in the table. It is pretty obvious that the QNAP TS-119 Turbo NAS performs well compared to the other products. In all areas except for the price it is ahead of it competitors. Unfortunately it is the most expensive option as well. The Netgear ReadyNAS Duo RND2000 looks like a pretty nice product as well. I have seen many nice reviews on the box and would be really tempted at investing in this product if it had not been for the poor results concerning power consumption. Power consumption for idle mode is satisfactory though and one might argue that this is the most important part when it comes to power consumption.

## Conclusion

Right now I am torn between the QNAP TS-109 Pro II and the ReadyNAS server. The QNAP server has great power consumption figures but costs the same as the ReadyNAS server which seems to be the more professional product. Both products have received good reviews and would be good buys. But you would be getting a more elegant RAID1 solution by buying the ReadyNAS server (you need to connect an external hard drive for the QNAP server). The ReadyNAS can furthermore be upgraded by adding more memory, I am not sure the QNAP server offers the same. The QNAP server on the other hand is very power efficient.
