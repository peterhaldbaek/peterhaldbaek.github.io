I happen to own an [Amitech 390B](http://www.amitech.dk/vis/p/tv/24-led-tv-dvd-390b/) LED TV and noticed a very peculiar behavior when I was watching [Swedish television](http://svt.se/) (SVT1, SVT2 or SVTB/SVT24). Teletext would be turned on automatically every 10 minutes or so which was highly annoying since it had to be turned off again manually. Since I do not use the screen for watching television anyway it did not really matter but I still found it weird and last night I thought of something that might fix it.

When teletext is turned on it is not only turned on but it is always at page 800 (as I recall). This made me think about how teletext can be used to show subtitles and maybe subtitles on these channels would make use of teletext. In the cases where subtitles actually are present at these pages it works but when subtitles are turned on and they are not available this page shows. I tried turning subtitles off... and the issue disappeared.

So if you are facing these issues, simply turn off the subtitles.
