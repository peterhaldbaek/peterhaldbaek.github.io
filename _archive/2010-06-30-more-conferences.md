Recently I have been looking more into the mobile platform (mainly Android) and have discovered a whole new set of conferences which all of a sudden seem really interesting. These are

* [Google I/O](http://code.google.com/events/io/), May, San Francisco
* [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/), June, San Francisco

The Google I/O conference looks like a must and I really hope I get the chance to participate. The Apple conference has a broader audience as it is not only targeting the iPhone but all things related to Apple so this conference does not get me too excited.
