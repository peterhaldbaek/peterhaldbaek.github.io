I ended up buying these components for my HTPC

* **Motherboard** AsRock K10N78FULLHD-HSLI R3.0
* **CPU** AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core 4850e
* **GPU** ASUS EN8400GS SILENT HTP 512M
* **Memory** HyperX 2GB 800MHZ DDR2 NON-ECC
* **HDD** Western Digital Scorpio/500GB 2.5" SATAII 5400rpm 8MB encapsulated in Scythe Quiet Drive 2.5"
* **DVD** Pioneer DVR-216DBK, SATA, Black
* **Tuner** Hauppauge Nova-T 500
* **Case** Antec New Solution NSK2480

I am very pleased with the components so far. I needed to add a graphics card since the motherboard does not have any TV-out and I am still stuck with my old television. Although flat screens are getting increasingly cheaper I am pretty happy with my television and feel I get better value by waiting for the standards to stabilize a bit (DVB-T2 anyone?). So I needed TV-out for now.

I toyed around with undervolting the build and got really nice results. I'll might post my experiences later.

I might add the following items to the build:

*   Scythe Ninja Mini CPU heatsink (the default heatsink is a bit noisy and since everything else is so nice and silent it feels stupid not to add this)
*   Pico PSU
*   Logitech DiNovo Mini keyboard
*   Some cheap USB gamepads
