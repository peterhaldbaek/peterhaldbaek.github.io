I do not participate in a whole lot of conferences but I do like to go if I find something worth attending. One conference I really appreciated was the [Colorado Software Summit](http://www.coloradosoftwaresummit.com/) (CSS) which unfortunately has closed down. There was not one thing I did not like about this conference (ok, maybe the weather could be a little warmer ;) ). Great location (up in the mountains), great speakers, a small dedicated crowd of attendants, a chance to see the Broncos live and lots of other things. I only participated twice, I wish I had gone more often. This conference is surely missed not only by me.

Hopefully someone will start something similar but sometimes change is not a bad thing after all. So now on to the big question: Which conference should I attend next? I did some research and have found these alternatives which do not look too bad:

*   [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.com/), Antwerp, November
*   [The Rich Web Experience](http://www.therichwebexperience.com/), Orlando, December
*   [TheServerSide Java Symposium](http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/), Las Vegas, March

I could include [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone) on the list but I have been there (once, in the glory dot com days of the early 2000s) and liked CSS so much better. But going to San Francisco is not a bad thing at all so I might change my mind. Right now I am tempted most by the Rich Web Experience in Orlando. If you know of other interesting conferences please let me know! I am mostly looking for Java or Web 2.0 'ish conferences.
