So here is a quick look at the hard drives I have been looking at.

## Seagate Momentus 5400.6 500 GB

* Pros: 2.5", low power consumption, silent
* Cons: Expensive

## Western Digital Scorpio Blue 500 GB

* Pros: 2.5", low power consumption, silent
* Cons: Expensive

## HDD - Samsung SpinPoint F1 HD753LJ 750GB

* Pros: Silent, cheap
* Cons: 2.5" hard drives are more quiet (but also more expensive), 3.5"
