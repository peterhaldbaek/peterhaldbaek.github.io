At first I was pretty confident about going with the Asus M3N78-VM motherboard since it seemed like the perfect choice. Power consumption was a concern though and it is reportedly not possible to undervolt the motherboard so I decided to take a look at some more options before buying anything.

My requirements are:

*   Compatible with AMD 4850e CPU
*   HDMI
*   Onboard NVidia graphics, at least 8200
*   Power efficientThe motherboards I found so far are:

## Asus M3N78-VM

* Pros: Reliable motherboard (proven vendor), NVidia 8200
* Cons: No undervolting

## ASRock K10N78FullHD-hSLI R3.0

* Pros: Power efficent, supports undervolting and does it apparently pretty well, NVidia 8200, cheap (408 kr)
* Cons: None so far :)
