Just stumbled upon some more interesting conferences. I really wanted to go to [Google IO](http://www.google.com/events/io/2011) and/or [WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) but these conferences sell out in like 2 seconds so my odds of ever going to one of these events seem slim. But there are other interesting conferences out there and here is a quick list of what I have found so far:

* [Android Open](http://androidopen.com/android2011) Oct. 9-11 in San Francisco
* [App Conference and Hackaton](http://appdevconf.engagedigital.com/) Oct. 26-27 in Santa Clara (not really a conference but looks fun)

And if you feel like going to Africa why not try

* [Mobile Web Africa](http://www.mobilewebafrica.com/) Nov. 22-25 in Johannesburg, South Africa
