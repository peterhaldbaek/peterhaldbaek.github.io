In February last year [Google introduced paid apps](http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/13/google-now-accepting-paid-apps-in-android-market/) to the [Android Market](http://www.android.com/market/). This was introduced in the US and UK and I expected this to spread out to the rest of World pretty quickly. I could not be more wrong. As of today Android Market only offers [paid apps in these countries](http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=138294):

*   Australia
*   Austria
*   Canada
*   France
*   Germany
*   Italy
*   Japan
*   Netherlands
*   New Zealand
*   Spain
*   Switzerland
*   United Kingdom
*   United States

Where is Scandinavia not to mention countries like China, India and Brazil (or say South America)? I cannot believe that we 18 months later lack big economies like China and India. It is beyond me. What could the reasons for this be? Apple had the advantage of building their App Store within the concepts defined by iTunes and thereby inherited the easy [1-Click](http://www.apple.com/itunes/how-to/index.html#store-oneclick) shopping philosophy. Google do not have this but Google's pennant to 1-Click [Google Checkout](http://checkout.google.com/) is not a bad competitor so what is holding them back?

My fears are that if Google does not address this matter soon the Android Market will die. It will be separated into two markets (already happening), paid apps from the countries inside the paid apps zone competing against free apps from countries outside of the zone. This will drive prices on apps down making it harder for developers to make a living of creating apps thus decreasing the quality of the apps in the store. When the quality of apps drops people start looking for better alternatives and my guess is they will turn to the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) and the [Apple App Store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/). I am not blaming them.

Now, developers can make money on their apps in other ways than getting paid upfront for the app. They can add ads to their app or offer more functionality (or ad-free apps) outside of the store. But then the developer would have to worry about implementing their own payment service which again would drive developers to other alternatives. If Google does not see this I am afraid the Android Market will die before it even got started.

## Update 27.8.2010

Apparently my rant had some effect. South Korea has been added to the list! On a more hilarious note, I really like the image of the Android Market in my first link (the Engadget article).
