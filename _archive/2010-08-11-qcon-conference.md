I just stumbled across another interesting conference, the [QCon](http://qcon.infoq.com/) conference. QCon runs five times a year in London, San Francisco, Tokyo, Beijing, and Sao Paulo so travel distance is not a concern (although I have no problem with traveling to the US, Asia or especially Brazil). The target audience is team leads, architects, and project management and the conference rely heavily on the community. Hopefully some of the spirit from [Colorado Software Summit](http://www.softwaresummit.com/) can be found there. Next conference is November 1st - 5th 2010 in San Francisco.
