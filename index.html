The iOS version of Find Antenna finally supports the same countries as the Android version which means iPhone users in the United Kingdom, Germany and Sweden can now enjoy the app just as users in Denmark have been able to for some months. The update was also used to adjust some of the Danish transmitters since Boxer has decided to upgrade the transmitters at Borups Alle and Lynetten.</p>
<p>When the app starts it will automatically show you the transmitters of the country with the best signal. You can change country by clicking the menu icon at the top left and simply select the country you are interested in. It&#39;s as easy as that!</p>

I constantly uninstall apps to make room not only for new apps but also just to be able to update my existing apps despite having more than 2GBs available according to the Storage settings. It turns out (I assume) that this behavior is caused by logs hiding in the <code>/data/log</code> folder. Too bad it is not possible to delete the files unless the device is rooted which I have not done (yet). I am still hoping to figure something out and recently found out that there is a secret system menu if you dial <code>*#*#2846579#*#*</code> in the stock phone app. It did not help me with my problem though.</p>
<h2 id="update-22-04-2014">Update 22.04.2014</h2>
<p>After repeated searches for answers on the web about my internal memory issues with my Huawei came up fruitless I went ahead and rooted the device. Turns out there is no hidden <code>/data/log</code> folder (or any other folder containing garbage for that matter). I did find out that cleaning the <code>/data/tombstones</code> folder would give me (tiny) space improvements but overall the findings were very disapointing.</p>
<p>My next suspicion was looking a little bit closer at the storage required by the mandatory Google apps. It did seem like they were taking up a lot of space and since they cannot be moved to your SD card they are just hogging up internal memory. I figured a factory reset of my phone would reveal more. After the factory reset (but before updating all the mandatory apps) my phone had more than 600MB of internal memory (the phone is shipped with 1GB internal memory so I assume the rest is used for the OS). I updated all the mandatory Google apps and internal memory went down to 350MB! Experience has shown me that when the phone comes close to 100MB of free internal memory it starts getting cranky and <em>really</em> slow so this leaves me with 250MB of free space. Not really encouraging since all the mandatory apps like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Gmail, Chrome, Hangouts and Maps caches data in internal memory so it is only a matter of (short) time before I am back to square one. Did I mention that the apps are mandatory despite I am not using apps like Google+ or Hangouts and possibly others as well?</p>
<p>I understand that older phones over time are considered inferior to newer models but I do not expect older phones to become useless all of a sudden as is the case right now. I believe there is a huge market for budget, low-spec smartphones (especially in 3rd World countries) but if the OS keeps requiring us to install bigger and bigger mandatory apps from Google I think they are making a mistake.</p>

<p>Users of Find Antenna for iPhone must wait a little longer to enjoy this, but do not worry, it is coming to the iPhone as well in the near future!</p>
</div></article></li><li><article id="doc" class="odd post"><h1><a href="/posts/hello_docpad/">Hello DocPad</a></h1><div class="pubdate">Published January 16th 2014</div><div class="post-content"><p>Today I relaunched my blog. I wanted to skip the <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> platform for something more flexible for a long time and now I have finally made the switch. I examined a lot of Node blogging platforms and decided to go with <a href="http://docpad.org">DocPad</a>. I looked at other alternatives such as <a href="https://github.com/creationix/wheat">Wheat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/blacksmith">Blacksmith</a> but the simplicity of DocPad really won me over. There is no database as everything is stored as files, documents can come in any format or shape and the community is very vibrant (as any Node community these days) just to name a few of the selling points. It is the perfect platform for blogs so the decision was not very hard.</p>
<p>The switch also gave me a chance of redesigning the blog entirely. I was previously using a very old version of Blogger since I did not want to convert the templates to the new Blogger format as I would much rather use a new platform and spend my time on migrating to that. I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> for the styling but strongly considered trying something more <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/">OOCSS-like</a> just for the experience. The blog is now responsive and looks great on all the devices I tested so far.</p>
<p>I also introduced <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> as my comments framework. Previously I just used the built-in Blogger comments framework which worked but was not that exciting. So far I like Disqus although it has some quirks and some limits in regard to formatting.</p>
<p>The conclusion? I am pretty happy about the end result from more than one perspective. I have more control with my blog and the frameworks it uses. It is definitely a huge plus that my posts are now written as markdown documents removing (most) formatting and styling from the document itself leaving all styling to my templates and stylesheets. Overall a huge win, I would definitely consider DocPad for my future projects.</p>

The iPhone version of Find Antenna is available for download from the App Store. The functionality is the same as the Android version with some minor differences. I put a lot of work into the visual appearance of both app and icon to give a clearer visual identity. I also changed the layout of the app a little bit by using a scrollview instead of gesture recognizers to switch between transmitters. Representation of the signal strength was also changed to give a clearer indication on how to interpret the strength of the signal.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.com/apps/findantenna"><img src="/posts/find_antenna_now_available_on_iphone/appstore.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The first version of the app only contains Danish transmitters but more countries are expected to be supported shortly. I will add Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom and Australia in the near future. If you want your country added or have information on transmitters not on the list do not hesitate to contact me. </p>
<p>The app is available at the App Store so go get it while it&#39;s hot!</p>
